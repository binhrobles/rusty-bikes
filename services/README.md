# Rusty Bikes Services

## Bootstrapping

### Requirements

- [Cargo Lambda](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime)
  - Used to deploy into an AWS Lambda. Also provides a local `watch` environment, which I'm using when running locally to provide hot reloading and keep my dev runtime environment basically identical to the deployed environment.

Do it:

```bash
# (at project root) Use Makefile to fetch OSM data, create the db, and start the project
make service-watch

# hit it
curl http://localhost:9000/lambda-url/lambda-handler/traverse?lat=40.68376227690408&lon=-73.96167755126955&depth=20
```

### Leveraging OSM Data

The underlying data is coming from [OSM's Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API). The initial data dump is from this [OverpassQL query](./scripts/download_osm_data.sh), which gives us all relevant [Way](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way)'s tagged with the [key "highway"](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway) in a Manhattan-BK-centric view of NYC boroughs, along with their geometry data (lat-longs + referenced Node lat-longs).

<details>

<summary>Considerations</summary>
The first thought was to use the Overpass API directly while executing pathfinding. Benefits being: I wouldn't have to "own" any data, and could possibly make use of OverpassQL's recursive querying to offload some processing. 


This had a few issues:

- Every pathfinding algorithm invokes a "get neighbors" call in the middle of its nested execution loop, thousands of times. Introducing network fetch latency at that level would make pathfinding unusably slow.
- OSM data contains a lot of information that isn't relevant to pathfinding (like building and jurisdiction info). Filtering would take up processing for every request to OSM.

To make the problem more manageable, scope was cut to _just_ bike pathfinding in _just_ NYC. This allowed me to apply a set of filters and a bounding box to the Overpass Query resulting in a ~50MB json file. For comparison, the full planet OSM is [1915 GB uncompressed](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm) and the NYC bounding box with ALL Ways (not including bike-relevant filtering) is ~300MB.

Although this does mean owning the data layer for this project, at this scale, we have a lot of flexibility. See [Database Design](#database-design)

### Data Transformation

Using OSM tags, we can create a consistent data model for understanding the roads in terms of bike-ability. We'll do this _before_ loading the data into our DB, so we can interact with our own data model at runtime rather than the vast OSM tag landscape.

We'll do a lossy translation from that space into 3 dimensions: **Road** type, **Cycleway** type, and **Directionality / Salmoning**.

Because of directionality, we'll save labeling metadata for each **Way** twice, once for the "standard" direction, and once for the "reverse" direction. We'll indicate this by creating 2 Way entries, one with the regular, positive ID, and one with same ID, but _negative_. We can be certain that [no OSM IDs will be negative](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements#Common_attributes). The `Road` type will always be the same, but the `Cycleway` and `Salmon` tags may differ.

When assessing the reverse OSM direction, we will check for dedicated infrastructure in this direction, or use the contraflow bike infra, before judging the route as a salmon route.

<details>

<summary>Considerations</summary>

The first naive thought was to dump all the tags into a denormalized table or onto the DB representation of the Ways themselves, and have the pathfinding service make cost function decisions at query-time based on tags. 

However, after learning more about how OSM tagging landscape, it was apparent that the rules engine would be large, with many edge cases. See:

- https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bicycle
- https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/cycleway#values
- https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:cycleway:right:oneway
- [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Forward*%26_backward,\_left*%26_right](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Forward_%26_backward,_left_%26_right)


Data simplification could happen _before_ pathfinding-time, and, if it was, it made sense to do it as part of an ETL process _before_ the data even made it into the DB itself. This would move this processing out of execution logic and allow us to perform [testing / validation](#labeling-examples) on the resulting dataset.

#### Road Type

Standardizing the OSM [`highway` tag landscape](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/highway#values) into the [North American road hierarchy standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_hierarchy#United_States_and_Canada) of Local, Collector, and Arterial. Adding Bike and Pedestrian for protected bike paths and pedestrian-centric paths.

See [OverpassQL query](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1My7) for these highway designations.

Types:

- **Pedestrian**

  - Rounding [highway=path](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dunclassified) "down" to pedestrian

  ```
  ["highway"="pedestrian"]
  ["highway"="crossing"]
  ["highway"="corridor"]
  ["highway"="footway"]
  ["highway"="path"]
  ["bicycle"="dismount"]
  ```

- **Bike**

  ```
  ["highway"="cycleway"]
  ```

- **Local**

  - [highway=unclassified](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dunclassified)

  ```
  ["highway"="residential"]
  ["highway"="living_street"]
  ["highway"="unclassified"]
  ["highway"="track"]
  ```

- **Collector** (default)

  - absent other designations, we'll default here conservatively

  ```
  ["highway"="secondary"]
  ["highway"="secondary_link"]
  ["highway"="tertiary"]
  ["highway"="tertiary_link"]
  ```

- **Arterial**
  ```
  ["highway"="primary"]
  ["highway"="primary_link"]
  ```

#### Salmon? (Directionality)

You're either going _with_ traffic (**salmon=false**, default) or _against_ traffic (**salmon=true** üêü). We'll default to the assumption that every path is bidirectional unless there are _explicit_ indicators that the road is a one-way. Then, we will need _explicit_ indicators that bikes can ride bidirectionally.

For the OSM-normal direction:
- **salmon=false** (default)
  - Since the Way is plotted in this direction, I can't really think of any reason why there would be salmoning here.

For OSM-reverse direction:
- **salmon=false** (default)
  ```
  [~"^cycleway:.*:oneway$"="no"] // indicates that the cycleway, despite other indicators, is bidirectional
  ["oneway:bicycle"="no"]       // lesser used in NYC
  ```

- **salmon=true**
  ```
  ["oneway"="yes"]               // indicates that the road is one-way, so, absent other indicators, any bike infra is also oneway
  [~"^cycleway:.*:oneway$"="yes"] // explicitly indicates that the bike infra on this side is oneway
  ["oneway:bicycle"="yes"]       // lesser used in NYC
  ```

#### Cycleway Type

Note: `^cycleway` is referring to the collection of `cycleway:right`, `cycleway:left`, and `cycleway:both`, which all refer to bike infra on the Way.

Because of directionality, `left` and `right` will be important designations. On bidirectional roads, `left`, in the direction the Way has been plotted in OSM, will be the cycleway in the _incoming_ direction while `right` will designate the path along the primary direction. On oneway roads, the `left` or `right` cycleways can be used as primary direction cycleways. When the `cycleway:{direction}:oneway=no` tag is present, this is an explicit indicator that there is bidirectional bike infra, even if the road itself is a oneway for cars.

Types:

- **Track**

  - Indicates a bike path _separate_ from the road
    ```
    ["bicycle"="designated"]
    ["highway"="cycleway"]
    [~"^cycleway"~"track"]
    ```

- **Lane**

  - Indicates a designated bike path _along_ the road
    ```
    [~"^cycleway"~"lane"]
    ```

- **Shared**

  - Explicit indications that bikes are welcome to _share_ the road, generally in the form of a ["sharrow"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_lane_marking)
    ```
    [~"^cycleway"~"shared_lane"]
    ```

- **No** (default)

  - No bike infra exists here!
    ```
    [~"^cycleway"~"no"]
    ```

### Labeling Examples

One of the joys of this project, and why I wanted to work on it, is that the data is a representation of the built world! Because of this, I was able to think up / find roads around NYC that would act as interesting edge cases for this test suite, and logically assign the labels they should acquire after the ETL process. These first lived as notes, and then were baked into the test suite, which was executed in the ETL development loop, editing the rules engine, processing the OSM JSON, and testing the output SQLite DB.

See [test suite](./tests/way-labeling.rs)

<summary>Example Test Cases</summary>

#### Ex 1: Bidirectional Road w/ One Bike Lane

[Clermont Ave](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/654744285#map=16/40.6911/-73.9704&layers=Y) is mapped from North to South, so `right` designations apply to the southbound direction, and `left` designations apply to the northbound direction.

The tags:

```
cycleway:right = lane
highway = residential
```

indicate that it is a local road with a designated bike lane on the road going south, but nothing on the road going north. The lack of the `oneway` tag means it is an implicitly bidirectional road.

In this case, we'll label standard direction Way (654744285) to be `Road.Local`, `Cycleway.Lane`, and the reverse direction Way (-654744285) to be `Cycleway.No`, `Salmon=true`.

#### Ex 2: Bidirectional Road w/ Bike Lanes going both ways
[7th Ave in Park Slope](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/494221659) is a bidirectional road with bike lanes on both sides, going both ways.

The tags:
```
cycleway:left = lane
cycleway:right = shared_lane
highway = tertiary
oneway = no
```
indicate to us that road going the OSM-normal direction has a `Cycleway.Shared`, while the OSM-reverse direction has a `Cycleway.Lane`. The explicit `oneway=no` tells us that no salmon will be prepared.

#### Ex 3: One Way Road with Bike Lane (on either side)

[Hoyt St](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/844446016#map=20/40.68871/-73.98636&layers=Y) and [Smith St](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/420572575#map=20/40.68955/-73.98850&layers=Y) are southbound and northbound streets (respectively) with bike lanes on the left and right sides (also respectively). This case shows that the right side is not necessarily the "forward" direction, just as the left side is not necessarily the "backward" direction.

The tags:
```
cycleway:left = no
cycleway:right = track
cycleway:right:oneway = yes
highway = secondary
oneway = yes
```
and
```
cycleway:left = lane
cycleway:left:oneway = yes
cycleway:right = no
highway = residential
oneway = yes
```
indicate that they are each one-way roads with bike lanes that are one-way themselves, going along with traffic.

In this case, we'll label the standard direction Ways (844446016, 420572575) appropriately, and the reverse direction Ways with `Salmon=true`.

#### Ex 4: Bidirectional Bike Lane
[Chrystie St](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/464964299) is mapped South to North, so `right` designations apply to the northbound direction.

The tags:
```
cycleway:left = no
cycleway:right = track
cycleway:right:oneway = no
highway = secondary
oneway = no
```
indicate that it is a bidirectional collector road with designated, bidirectional bike infra on the right side of the road.

We'll label the standard direction Way (464964299) to be `Road.Collector`, `Cycleway.Track`. Since there is no left-side bike infra and the right side is one-way, the salmoning biker would use the right-side Track, or: (-464964299) => `Cycleway.Track`, `Salmon=false`.

#### Ex 5: Edge Case! One Way Road and a Contraflow Bike Lane
[Bond St bw Schermerhorn and Livingston](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/455014439) is mapped South to North, so `right` designations apply to the northbound direction.

The tags:
```
cycleway:right = track
cycleway:right:oneway = -1
highway = residential
oneway = yes
oneway:bicycle = no
```
indicate that it is a one-way local road going northbound, but with a designated bike lane going south, on the right side.

We'll label the standard direction Way (455014439) to be `Road.Local`, `Cycleway.No`, `Salmon=false`. The reverse (-455014439) will be labeled `Cycleway.Track`, `Salmon=false`.

</details>

### Routing Cost Function

This piece of the system should use the bike path labels to return high "costs" for undesireable biking paths (like busy streets with no dedicated bike lanes (ie: [Atlantic Ave](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/1204342261)), and low "costs" for desireable biking paths (like [along Flushing Ave / BK Naval Yards](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/488161824)).

### Query Optimization

To support an efficient A\* implementation:

- Looking up Node neighbors must be as fast as possible
  - adjacency matrix lookup should be quick
- Costs must be calculated quickly
  - Labels should be quickly available for each Way
- We must be able to locate the Way that is closest to our start / end points
  - Store Ways in an [R\*Tree](https://sqlite.org/rtree.html) index, easily done due to their min/max coords
  - Given a way and a coordinate, where along the Way is this coordinate?

### Database Design

Those considerations point us to a SQLite schema of:

```mermaid
---
title: Rusty Bikes Schema

erDiagram
    WAY {
        float min_lat
        float max_lat
        float min_lon
        float max_lon
    }
    NODE {
        float lat
        float lon
    }
    WAYNODE {
        int pos
        ID node FK
        ID way FK
    }
    SEGMENT {
        ID n1 FK
        ID n2 FK
        ID way FK
    }
    WAYLABEL {
        ID  way FK
        int cycleway
        int road
        bool salmon
    }

    WAYLABEL }|--|| WAY : describes

    WAY ||--|{ WAYNODE : "is a series of"
    NODE }|..o{ WAYNODE : composes

    WAY ||--|{ SEGMENT : has
    WAYNODE ||--|{ SEGMENT : defines
    NODE }|..o{ SEGMENT : in
```

### Hosting

Since the SQlite DB is ~15MB zipped and the data access is read-only, currently packaging the DB into the lambda artifact. To reduce deploy times (though marginally) and have a more sacred deploy artifact, I'll probably upload the SQLite DB as a separate Lambda Layer that will get updated on some regular basis, w/ a separate Lambda cron. After that, it's just a simple HTTP API Gateway -> Lambda integration to host this real cheap.

I kinda felt bad about making this choice, because I was a bit excited about getting deep on Tokio concurrency and such, and the AWS Lambda environment brings concurrency to the system-level, but being able to host this simply, for free, outweighed that.
