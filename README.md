# Rusty Bikes
A project for learning Rust. Implementing [OpenRouteService's Direction API](https://giscience.github.io/openrouteservice/api-reference/endpoints/directions/) to get a feel for serving an API, threads, pathfinding algs, and OSM data.

Used w/ my [ORS map client fork](https://github.com/binhrobles/ors-map-client-rusty-fork)
